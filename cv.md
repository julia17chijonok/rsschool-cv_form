## About Me:
I am 20 years old. Now I work as a pharmacist. But I would like to become a programmer, because it is interesting for me and gives great opportunities for career growth. I like the frontend so I decided to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript on my own.

## Skills:
* HTML
* CSS (SASS/SCSS, BEM) 
* JavaScript
* Git/GitHub
* Figma

## Code Examples
```
function findAverage(array) {
  if (array.length == 0){
        return 0;
    }
    else {
        average = array.reduce((sum, current) => sum + current) / array.length;
        return average;
    }
}
```
